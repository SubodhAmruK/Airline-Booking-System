***Need To download All the 4 files in order for the code to run***


Today everyone are busy with their schedule and none of us have time to make a trip for holidays with their family. And this Airline Booking Process is very complicated to understand in general. But we are providing a solution for that problem. An airline booking system is part of the so-called passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.

This system provides a facility for easy access towards customers and real time users. They can easily connect through it in just 3 steps. There is no requirement for any type of Agent. We are giving all this facilities in one project “Airline Booking System” The project is developed using the C language. It was designed to be compiled with different compilers and can run on most hardware platforms, which means you don't have to know everything about the memory layout of your machine in order to write programs for it. C has many built-in functions that make it easier for programmers to write programs and many more!.

Features we provide in our project:
1. Information on flights and its reservations.
2. Rich in graphics which are very attractive.
3. User friendly.
4. Customer care details in case of any enquiries.

It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ABSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations. 

The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.
